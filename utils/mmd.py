def maximum_mean_discrepancy(x, y, kernel=utils.util.gaussian_kernel_matrix):
  r"""Computes the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) of two samples: x and y.
  Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) is a distance-measure between the samples of
  the distributions of x and y. Here we use the kernel two sample estimate
  using the empirical mean of the two distributions.
  MMD^2(P, Q) = || \E{\phi(x)} - \E{\phi(y)} ||^2
              = \E{ K(x, x) } + \E{ K(y, y) } - 2 \E{ K(x, y) },
  where K = <\phi(x), \phi(y)>,
    is the desired kernel function, in this case a radial basis kernel.
  Args:
      x: a tensor of shape [num_samples, num_features]
      y: a tensor of shape [num_samples, num_features]
      kernel: a function which computes the kernel in MMD. Defaults to the
              GaussianKernelMatrix.
  Returns:
      a scalar denoting the squared maximum mean discrepancy loss.
